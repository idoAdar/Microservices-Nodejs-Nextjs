This service is tend to send events when order is expired.
The this is, that with NATS Streaming Server we cant fire events in specific time in the future
For that we use bull package.
Bull is a liberary that help us to send jobs (sort of events). the mechanisim works similar to NATS
but it is not build to be stable and strong like nats.
